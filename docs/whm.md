#### Indepth Scripting Explanation (IMPORTANT)
_by Wert_

1.  How to add scripts to your multiplayer mission

a)
Create HC(s) in your mission.
-   Insert Unit->Game Logic->Virtual Entities->Headless Client
-   Give it a unique name
-   Set it as playable

b)
Add "init.sqf" and "WerthlesHeadless.sqf" from:
@Werthles Headless Kit\Mission Scripts
to the mission folder, usually:
Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\<profile name here>\MPMissions\<mission name.map>

The parameters in "init.sqf" configure:
-   Repeat on/off
-   Repeat delay
-   Debug on/off
-   Balancing mode
-   Start delay
-   Sync delay

Use simple balancing with 1 HC or to ignore balancing.

c)
If WH may transfer AIs while they are waiting at trigger-synced waypoints, add a non-overlapping waypoint before it, and sync this to the same trigger. HC transfer causes a temporary desync.

d)
Re-save your mission as a multiplayer mission.
2. How to use the test mission
Move
@Werthles Headless Kit\Addons\HeadlessTest.Altis.pbo
into
Arma 3( Server)\MPMissions
or

3. How to start a server and connect HCs

Copy:
Arma 3\@Werthles Headless Kit\My Headless Kit
Arma 3\@Werthles Headless Kit\steam_appid
and paste as:
Arma 3( Server)\My Headless Kit
Arma 3( Server)\steam_appid
on the machines you will use as HCs or servers.

Then choose your next step:
a) Set up LAN game
b) Set up dedicated server game

Headless clients cannot connect to game clients hosting internet games.

a) Set up LAN game

i)
Start Arma 3 and host a LAN multiplayer game, with the password:
arma
If you will run the HC on the same machine, go to iii), then enter:
connect="-connect=localhost";

ii)
Open:
Arma 3\@Werthles Headless Kit\Get LAN IP
then note the machine's IPv4 address.

iii)
On your HC machine, open this with a text editor:
Arma 3( server)\My Headless Kit\Headless Client\ArmA2OA.par

iv)
Put the IP from ii) after connect="-connect=
E.g.
connect="-connect=192.168.0.10";

v)
If you have Arma 3( Server) installed on C:\ in the default location, start the HC using the appropriate shortcut from:
Arma 3( Server)\My Headless Kit\Example Shortcuts

vi)
If not, create a shortcut to:
Arma 3( Server)\arma3server.exe

vii)
Right click it and select properties.

viii)
At the end of "Target", add a space, then paste:
"-par=@My Headless Kit\Headless Client\ArmA2OA.par"

ix)
Double click on the shortcut to run the HC.

x)
You can start more than one HC per machine, or repeat this process on multiple machines Your HCs should join HC slots on your server.

b) Set up dedicated server game

You will need various internal and external IP addresses for this. To get them, open the folder:
Arma 3( Server)\My Headless Kit\
on the appropriate machine and run either
Get My Internal IP
(IPv4) or
Get My External IP
to get its IPs.

i)
On the server machine, in notepad, open:
Arma 3( Server)\My Headless Kit\Server\WerthlesHeadless_config.cfg

ii)
Add the external IPs of all external HCs and the internal IPs for all internal HCs to the headlessClients line, e.g.:
headlessClients[]={"81.46.54.91","192.168.0.55","56.45.87.19"...};

iii)
On the HC machine, in notepad, open:
Arma 3( Server)\My Headless Kit\Headless Client\ArmA2OA.par

iv)
Put the server's IP in this file after connect="-connect=
E.g. if connecting the HC to the server via LAN:
connect="-connect=192.168.0.10";
E.g. if connecting the HC to the server via the internet:
connect="-connect=81.46.54.91";

v)
If you have Arma 3( Server) installed on C:\ in the default location, start the server/HC using the appropriate shortcut from:
Arma 3( Server)\My Headless Kit\Example Shortcuts

vi)
If not, create shortcuts to:
Arma 3( Server)\arma3server.exe
for a HC and for the server.

vii)
Right click it and select properties.

viii)
At the end of "Target", add a space, then paste:
"-par=@My Headless Kit\Headless Client\ArmA2OA.par"
for the HC shortcut and:
"-par=@My Headless Kit\Server\ArmA2OA.par"
for the dedicated server shortcut.

ix)
Double click on the shortcuts to run the HCs and server.

x)
You can start more than one HC per machine, or repeat this process on multiple machines Your HCs should join HC slots on your server.

4. Other information

a) Opening Ports
To host an Arma 3 dedicated server, forwarded these ports to your computer (UDP):
2302, 2303, 3478, 4379, 4380, 27000 - 27050

Here is a good video of this.

b) Mods and Customisation
The files to alter are in:
Arma 3( Server)\My Headless Kit\Server
or
Arma 3( Server)\My Headless Kit\Headless

To launch your server/HC with mods, open the related:
Arma2OA.par
file and replace:
@Example mod 1
etc. with your mods' folder names, separating with a ;

<https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/basic.cfg>

c) Arma 3 Launcher
You can start HCs and servers with Arma 3 Launcher, however Arma 3 Server currently doesn't have this, and for HCs connecting via the internet, you would still need to alter .cfg files (possibly for LAN HCs too).

d) Compatibility
i)
Works alongside DAC, if set up as described by Monsoon.<www.armaholic.com>
Set a long enough WH start delay so DAC set up finishes first.
Enter DAC zone group numbers as:
(max total groups)/(No. of HCs).
DAC and WH scripts shouldn't affect each other. WH script will control editor/Zeus/other script created AIs, DAC will control DAC units only.
ii)
WH script changes AI unit locality. This could break some scripts where local commands are issued for units that are no longer local.
iii)
Compatible with UPSMON. Add a long enough start delay for UPSMON to set up first.
